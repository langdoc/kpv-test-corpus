# In Komi these are usually palatals, not palatalized

# also in this as many Russian loanwords are pronounced
# in more Russian manner. I don't know if more adequate

# The scheme above is now certainly missing some cases,
# but I hope it provides enough information to show the
# basic idea. The cases like ть$ should be mapped to t',
# so word final palatals are not treated now correctly.
# One problem is also that although one can describe the
# basic Komi phonology this way, in reality also Russian
# orthographic conventions surface occasionally, cases like
# *сентябь* could be pronounced as s'ent'abr' or s'ent'abr.

# Still missing: dialectal long vowels, vowel combinations etc.
