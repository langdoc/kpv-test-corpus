## Komi-Zyrian test corpus

This is a test corpus that incorporates Niko Partanen's personal work and two recordings from IKDP language documentation project. The files are not intended to be of particular use, but they are good examples of the tier standards that are enforced in Freiburg based language documentation projects. The standards are documented in [this wiki](https://github.com/langdoc/FRechdoc/wiki).
